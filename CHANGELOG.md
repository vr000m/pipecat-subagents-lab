## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Browser-first Pipecat voice-assistant lab using Small WebRTC and RTVI.
- Persistent, context-owning web-search workers backed by OpenAI hosted search.
- Structured routing across direct, unsupported, clarification, existing-worker,
  and new-worker outcomes.
- Canonical grounded results with separate complete display text and concise TTS
  projections.
- Server-authored transcript, routing, worker, result-history, delivery-state,
  timestamp, and reconnect projections.
- Local Nemotron STT and Pocket TTS integrations, with independently selectable
  Deepgram and Cartesia hosted alternatives.
- Smart Turn aggregation with configurable incomplete-turn timeout and
  complete-turn grace period.
- Repeatable local-versus-hosted speech latency benchmark.
- Credential-safe Python and browser contract, integration, and regression tests.

### Fixed

- Wire worker clarification into pending-dialogue continuation: a web-search
  worker's clarifying question (`WorkerClarify`) is now caught at every
  pipeline dispatch site and recorded with its original request. Natural
  answers resume the same worker through typed continuation context, compound
  replies retain the pending owner, and explicit unrelated requests route
  normally. Weather time and temperature modifiers no longer masquerade as
  locations. Adds the TOML/environment
  `pending_dialogue_timeout_seconds` setting, defaulting to 30 seconds.
- Keep a bounded set of timed-out worker searches alive for late UI delivery
  without autoplay, give each late result one delivery owner, cancel retained
  work during session shutdown, propagate caller cancellation, and redact
  provider exception details from operational logs.
- Stop active TTS before speaking pause or cancellation confirmation.
- Keep router prompts, decisions, and prose request-local so concurrent turns
  cannot observe another turn's prompt or response text.
